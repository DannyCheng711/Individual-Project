# MSc Individual Project

This repository contains the code and experiment logs for my MSc Individual Project:  
**"Collaborative Learning for Occlusion-Robust Object Detection on Ultra-Low-End Edge Devices"**.

## Structure
- `vocmain/` – Pretraining experiments (MCUNet + YOLOv2).
- `quanmain/`- Quantisation experiments (Pytorch -> TensorFlow -> TFLite)
- `colmain/` – Collaborative inference (feature-level and decision-level, WBF).
- `dflmain/` – Decentralised federated learning (FedAvg prototype).


## Notes
The project report explains all methods and results in detail.  
Due to project constraints, some scripts are research prototypes and may require adjustments to run in a different environment.
